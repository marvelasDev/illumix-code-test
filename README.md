Project was created for Unity Editor version 2022.3.33f1, per the spec. For ease of use and best compatibility, I have also included a **.unitypackage** file containing the project [**here.**](http://66.226.136.172/temp/Illumix_TicTacToe_Unity.unitypackage)  

**To use the .unitypackage File:**
1. Open a New Project in your current Unity Editor.
2. Drag the downloaded Illumix_TicTacToe_Unity.unitypackage file from your Finder/Explorer into the Assets folder.
3. Select 'Import' on the bottom right.
4. In Build Settings, make sure the Game.unity scene is the only scene listed (index 0).
5. Press Play and enjoy!
